# Where are you going? | SAP HANA Graph Community Challenge
[SAP Community Call: Challenge accepted – Gain hands-on experience with SAP HANA Graph](https://blogs.sap.com/2022/04/27/sap-community-call-challenge-accepted-gain-hands-on-experience-with-sap-hana-graph/)<br>
You work in WDF 53, your friend is in WDF 13. You haven’t seen each other in a while and therefore want to meet to have a chat over some coffee. Having busy schedules, you want to avoid that one must walk all the way while the other one can just stay in his building. Help them to find the building “in between”, so both of you need to walk a minimal distance.

The [data](data/) folder contains the data for this community challenge. It is provided as a SAP HANA Cloud database export. Just download *2022_GRAPH_CHALLENGE.tar.gz* to your local computer. The use the SAP HANA Database Explorer, right-click the "catalog" structure of your database, and choose "import catalog objects".
